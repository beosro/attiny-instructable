Source code for small ATtiny projects
=====================================

This source codes provide two small examples for an ATtiny tutorial that I have published at instructables: [Honey, I Shrunk the Arduino: Moving from Arduino to ATtiny and writing your code in pure AVR-C](http://www.instructables.com/id/Honey-I-Shrunk-the-Arduino-Moving-from-Arduino-t/).
